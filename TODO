known issues:

- when resizing the terminal while running slurm in screen it might be
  possible that the static parts of the window are not redrawn so we
  should care about signals.

- Solaris curses problems (Sat Dec 21 15:30:45 CET 2002)

  the solaris network stuff is ok but curses causes crashes
  UPDATE: fixed as of 2002-12-31.

- BNC media detection (Fri Dec  6 00:50:18 CET 2002)

  While testing slurm on OpenBSD (thanks Auge for the account) I discovered
  a problem regarding the ifmedireq flags. OpenBSD does not set
  IFM_ACTIVE or IFM_AVALID for BNC interfaces.

- high load on Linux 2.5 (Thu Dec  5 23:30:43 CET 2002)

  slurm caused 99% load on a Linux 2.5.40 box while transfering data
  on a saturated 100Mbit link.
  UPDATE: This hasn't been reproduced until now so it's low priority
          until someone reports it again.
  UPDATE: perhaps a usleep() problem might leads to wasting cpu cycles.

- NetBSD interface speed detecion code (Thu Dec  5 23:30:43 CET 2002)

  As of today the interface speed detection code seems to not work
  correctly on NetBSD/stable.
  UPDATE: This seems to only concern my sq interface on my Indy.

This matrix shows what works and what not. Feel free to contribute code.
