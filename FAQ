Q: Why does slurm have themes?
A: Because it can.

Q: I want to use slurm to do traffic accounting or MRTG graphs ...
A: slurm will not support this. Feel free to use the data gathering
   code from src/. I've started a small project called wormulon
   (http://www.wormulon.net/wormulon) which utilizes the slurm codebase
   to create output suitable for inclusion in mrtg, rrdtool or even
   the screen hardstatus line.

Q: Can I include slurm into the screen hardstatus line?
A: See previous question and have a look at wormulon.

Q: WTF is 'slurm'? / How did it all start?
A: The idea came up while installing Linux systems during a small
   Linux installation party. Using pppstatus to monitor the ADSL
   uplink I did not find any equivalent app for *BSD. Lacking a similar
   application I removed the Linux dependent ppp code from pppstatus
   and added FreeBSD sysctl() code for data aquisation at ~3AM the
   same night.
   Ripping off the connection time accounting and email checks I ended
   up with something useful. Adding it to my CVS repository it needed
   a name, so the first thing that came into my mind was 'slurm' since
   I just saw the latest Futurama episode featuring 'Slurm Mc Kenzie'
   and the 'Slurm Factory', hence the name slurm.
   P.S. wormulon which is based on slurm is the name of the homeplanet
        of Slurm McKenzie.

Q: Why are you not showing link information like 100MBits on Linux?
A: Linux does not have a common way to save media type an link information.
   Gathering those information with tools like mii-tool or ethtool involve
   reading data directly from the ethernet cards EEPROM and success
   depends the card. Have a look at the ethtool source code if you want
   to know how nasty the whole thing might get. Integrating this slurm
   would need suid root privileges on Linux which is normally a bad idea.
